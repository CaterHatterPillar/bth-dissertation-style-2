\acknowledgments

I would like to express my most respectful gratitude to Azathoth, Ghatanothoa, and Shub-Niggurath; without whom I would never have completed the task given.
Furthmore, I must acknowledge the contributions of Yog-Sothoth, Nyarlathotep, and Yig, all three of whom have contributed greatly to the conclusions presented in this thesis.\\
Cthulhu showed me the way, as he hath done unto many before me.
