bth-dissertation-style-2
========================

The BTH Dissertation Style 2 is created to allow students at Blekinge Institute of Technology to collaborate in improving a standardised LaTeX thesis template. Unlike [the first version of the bth-dissertation-style](https://github.com/CaterHatterPillar/bth-dissertation-style), the BTH Dissertation Style 2 is not meant to resemble earlier [closed-source institution LaTeX styles](https://studentportal.bth.se/web/studentportal.nsf/web.xsp/faculty_of_computing) which students have no right to modify and distribute.

The BTH Dissertation Style is derived from the ILLC Dissertation Style (used with permission) - as created by Marco Vervoort - and licensed under the BSD Clause-3 license.
